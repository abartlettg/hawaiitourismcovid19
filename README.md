Study of Hawaii COVID-19 Travel Restrictions and Impact

Summary: 
Since the onset of COVID-19, Hawaii has maintained the strictest travel restrictions of all US States.  Hawaii has also maintained one of the lowest rates of COVID-19 deaths compared to other states, second only to Vermont.  This study examines the timeline of these restrictions and both the impact to COVID-19 rates and Tourism.  

Context:
Tourism is the largest single source of private capital for Hawaii’s economy, bringing in over TWO BILLION dollars in tax revenue in 2019.   On any given day in Hawaii, there are 249,000 travelers in Hawaii spending $48.6 million (per day, based on 2019 data).  It should come as no surprise that Hawaii’s State Government is intertwined with the Tourism Business and public policy is highly influenced by what is good for Tourism. 

On March 26th, 2020, Hawaii implemented a 14-day quarantine on all travelers entering the state, as a response to COVID-19, essentially shutting down Tourism.  The path to re-opening has been long and arduous for Hawaii… and, as it stands at the time of this study, there is no measurable point at which the State has determined can warrant a promise of full re-opening.     

Audience:
•	Hawaii State Government
•	Hawaii Residents
•	Those w/Financial Interests in Hawaii
•	Travelers to Hawaii

Objectives:
•	Create visibility to both the positive and negative impacts resulting from the COVID restrictions that were put in place that effect Travelers and Hawaii Tourism.
•	Present the data in an approachable way for evaluating which measures were more effective than other measures (had a better cost/benefit balance).
•	As Hawaii is still not fully re-opened, provide data in such a way that can help determine if Hawaii should be fully re-opened now. 
•	As we can expect additional variants of COVID-19 to emerge in coming years, use the insights gained from this data to optimize future public policy related to travel into Hawaii.
